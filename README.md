## UpCloud API documentation

The full API documentation can be found on https://www.upcloud.com/api/ and has
been partly added to the PHP DocBlocks.

## Credits

The original version of this API is done by [skaisser](https://github.com/skaisser/upcloud) but as it was a shameless and uncredited copy of the [DigitalOceanV2 api by toin0u](https://github.com/toin0u/DigitalOceanV2), I have removed most references but left in a few nonetheless.
This version has been forked by [integr.io](http://integr.io/) for use in one of
our Symfony applications as the original was not functional at all.
